# hands-free-notes
Created by Noah, Andrew, Wylie, and Will.


All components, other than the codebase and testing frameworks, will be located in the FinalSubmission folder.

Many final submission requirements are sections in the design doc (like unit tests, mocks, etc.).

The Swift Tests for UI and unit tests are in /HandsFreeNotes next to the XCode project container. The testing framework that uses these tests is built into the Xcode project and requires it to be opened in Xcode.

The Gherkins/BDD testing framework is also inside the XCode Project, and must be opened in Xcode. The Gherkins we created are under the PR/FAQ in the same doc.

There is no Package.swift in the project, so you can not run this from terminal as is. Please reach out if you run into any issues.
