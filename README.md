# Hands Free Notes
Created by Noah, Andrew, Wylie, and Will.

All components, other than the codebase and testing frameworks, will be located in the FinalSubmission folder under separate subfolders for 491, 492, and 493.

Many final submission requirements are sections in the design doc (like unit tests, mocks, etc.).

## Obtaining a Working Demo

Since this is a mobile application, we are unable to provide a fully workable demo in this repository, but we can provide steps to run our repository on your machine. 

1. Make sure Flutter is installed on your machine. Steps to do so can be found [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/quick)

2. This application is created using the Flutter framework, which provides support for both android and ios development. Our end product is intended to be used on IOS devices, however development on Windows machines is required to use an android emulator. Steps on how to download and create one can be found [here.](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/android/setup)

4. Make sure your emulator is linked with VSCode.

3. Clone the repository.

4. CD to OneTouch/one_touch and run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install dependencies.

5. Run `flutter run` to start the application with the linked emulator.
