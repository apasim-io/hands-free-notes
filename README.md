# hands-free-notes

Created by Noah, Andrew, Wylie, and Will.

The Swift Tests for UI and unit tests are in /HandsFreeNotes next to the XCode project container. The testing framework that uses these tests is built into the Xcode project and requires it to be opened in Xcode.

The Gherkins testing framework is also inside the XCode Project, and must be opened in Xcode.

There is no Package.swift in the project, so you can not run this from terminal as is. Please reach out if you run into any issues.
